        1 June 2021 saw online festivities as the Principal of SJBHS, Fr Sunil Fernandes SJ was greeted by staff as he logged onto MS Teams. Prayers and invocations were followed by the traditional birthday song as the cake was cut.

        The Primary School Administrator, Rev Fr Joel SJ, in his message described the Principal as a smiling person, known for his good intentions and honest work, his love and compassion and for all of us at St Joseph’s.

        A recorded message from the Principal of SJPUC, Rev Fr Melvin SJ, lauded Fr Sunil’s servant leadership model. He enumerated the qualities that made the Principal of SJBHS a visionary, a leader and the blue-eyed boy of the Karnataka Jesuits.

        The Principal was greeted by representatives of all the classes from LKG to Std XII through recorded videos. Fr Sunil was overwhelmed by the magnitude of the affection showered on him. Greetings by teachers and songs and dances by the staff and students in the online celebration highlighted the love and regard that the Team@SJBHS has for their Captain.

        The Vice Principal, Mr. Uday Kumar, in his message praised Fr Sunil’s calm demeanor, his ability to excel and his clarity of thought.

        Fr Sunil took the opportunity to introduce Fr Vishal D’Souza SJ who would take over the reins from the out-going Primary School Administrator, Fr Joel.
